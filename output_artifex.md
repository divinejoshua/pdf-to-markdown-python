[with international operations in Benin, Ghana, Zambia, and Togo. The](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin)
[Dangote Group has moved from being a trading company to being the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_company)
largest industrial group in Nigeria, encompassing divisions like Dangote
[Sugar Refinery, Dangote Cement, and Dangote Flour.[[16]] Dangote Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_Cement)
dominates the sugar market in Nigeria, and its refinery business is the
main supplier (70 percent of the market) to the country's soft drink
companies, breweries, and confectioners. The company employs more
than 11,000 people in West Africa.

[In July 2012, Dangote approached the Nigerian Ports Authority to lease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Ports_Authority)
[an abandoned piece of land at the Apapa Port, which was approved.[[17]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apapa_Port_Complex)

He later built facilities for his sugar company there. It is the largest Dangote in 2011
refinery in Africa and the third largest in the world, producing 800,000
metric tons of sugar annually. The Dangote Group owns salt factories
and flour mills and is a major importer of rice, fish, pasta, cement, and fertilizer. The company exports
cotton, cashew nuts, cocoa, sesame seeds, and ginger to several countries. Additionally, it has major
investments in real estate, banking, transport, textiles, oil, and gas.


In February 2022, Dangote announced the completion of the Peugeot assembling facility in Nigeria
[following his partnership with Stellantis Group, the parent company of Peugeot, and the Kano and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis)
Kaduna state governments. The new automobile company, Dangote Peugeot Automobiles Nigeria
Limited (DPAN) factory, which is based in Kaduna, commenced operations with the roll-out of the
[Peugeot 301, 508, 3008, 5008, and Landtrek.[[18]]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_301_(2012))

[On 22 May 2023 in Lekki, Nigeria, Dangote commissioned the Dangote Refinery. The plant plans to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki)
export surplus petrol, turning Africa's biggest oil producer into an export hub for petroleum products. It
also plans to export diesel, according to Dangote, who funded the refinery's construction. The refinery is
[situated on a 6,180-acre (2,500 hectares) site at the Lekki Free Trade Zone, Lekki, Lagos State. It is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki_Free_Zone)
supplied with crude oil by the largest sub-sea pipeline infrastructure in the world at 1,100 kilometres
(680 mi) long.

In May 2024, Aliko Dangote reaffirmed his ambitions regarding the re-appropriation of energy resources
in Africa: “My dream is to use raw materials from Africa, refine them and sell them on our own
market.[[19]]

## Wealth

Dangote became Nigeria's first billionaire in 2007.[[20]] Dangote reportedly added $9.2 billion to his
personal wealth in 2013, according to the _[Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the 30th-richest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Billionaires_Index)_
[person in the world at the time, and the richest person in Africa.[[21]] In 2015, the HSBC leaks revealed that](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Leaks)
