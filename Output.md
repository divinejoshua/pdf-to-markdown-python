Today, the Dangote Group is one of the largest conglomerates in Africa, ![](Output.009.png)![](Output.010.png)with international operations in [Benin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin), [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana), [Zambia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia), and [Togo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Togo). The Dangote Group has moved from being a [trading company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_company) to being the largest industrial group in Nigeria, encompassing divisions like Dangote Sugar Refinery, [Dangote Cement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_Cement), and Dangote Flour.[\[16\]](#_page4_x26.25_y665.25) Dangote Group 

dominates the sugar market in Nigeria, and its refinery business is the main  supplier  (70  percent  of  the  market)  to  the  country's  soft  drink companies, breweries, and confectioners. The company employs more than 11,000 people in West Africa. 

In July 2012, Dangote approached the [Nigerian Ports Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Ports_Authority) to lease 

an abandoned piece of land at the [Apapa Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apapa_Port_Complex), which was approved.[\[17\]](#_page5_x26.25_y0.00) 

He later built facilities for his sugar company there. It is the largest Dangote in 2011

refinery in Africa and the third largest in the world, producing 800,000

metric tons of sugar annually. The Dangote Group owns salt factories

and flour mills and is a major importer of rice, fish, pasta, cement, and fertilizer. The company exports cotton, cashew nuts, cocoa, sesame seeds, and ginger to several countries. Additionally, it has major investments in real estate, banking, transport, textiles, oil, and gas.

In February 2022, Dangote announced the completion of the Peugeot assembling facility in Nigeria following  his  partnership  with  [Stellantis  Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellantis),  the  parent  company  of  Peugeot,  and  the  Kano  and Kaduna  state  governments.  The  new  automobile  company,  Dangote  Peugeot  Automobiles  Nigeria Limited (DPAN) factory, which is based in Kaduna, commenced operations with the roll-out of the [Peugeot 301](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_301_\(2012\)), [508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_508), [3008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_3008), [5008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_5008), and [Landtrek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peugeot_Landtrek).[\[18\]](#_page5_x26.25_y43.50)

On 22 May 2023 in [Lekki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki), Nigeria, Dangote commissioned the [Dangote Refinery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangote_Refinery). The plant plans to export surplus petrol, turning Africa's biggest oil producer into an export hub for petroleum products. It also plans to export diesel, according to Dangote, who funded the refinery's construction. The refinery is situated on a 6,180-acre (2,500 hectares) site at the [Lekki Free Trade Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lekki_Free_Zone), Lekki, [Lagos State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State). It is supplied with crude oil by the largest sub-sea pipeline infrastructure in the world at 1,100 kilometres (680 mi) long.

In May 2024, Aliko Dangote reaffirmed his ambitions regarding the re-appropriation of energy resources in Africa:  “My  dream  is  to  use  raw  materials  from Africa,  refine  them  and  sell  them  on  our  own

market.[\[19\]](#_page5_x26.25_y87.00)

**Wealth![](Output.011.png)**

Dangote  became  Nigeria's  first  billionaire  in  2007.[\[20\]](#_page5_x26.25_y157.50)  Dangote  reportedly  added  $9.2  billion  to  his personal wealth in 2013, according to the [*Bloomberg Billionaires Index*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Billionaires_Index), making him the 30th-richest

person in the world at the time, and the richest person in Africa.[\[21\]](#_page5_x26.25_y201.00) In 2015, the [HSBC leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Leaks) revealed that Dangote was a HSBC client and that he had assets in a tax haven in the [British Virgin Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Virgin_Islands).[\[22\]](#_page5_x26.25_y244.50)[\[23\]](#_page5_x26.25_y288.00)

Together with his brother, Sayyu Dantata, Dagnote is linked to shell companies residing in tax havens by the [Panama Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers), [Paradise Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Papers)[\[24\]](#_page5_x26.25_y358.50) and the [Pandora Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_Papers).[\[25\]](#_page5_x26.25_y402.00)
