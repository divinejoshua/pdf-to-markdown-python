Dantata,  was  the  daughter  of  businessman  Sanusi
Dantata.[7]  His  father,  Mohammed  Dangote,  was  a
business  associate  of  Dantata.[8]  Through  his  mother,
he  is  the  great-grandson  of  Alhassan  Dantata,  the
richest person in West Africa at the time of his death in
1955.[9]  Dangote's  brother,  Sani  (1959/60–2021),  was

₦500,000  loan  from  his  uncle  to  begin  trading  in
commodities,  including  bagged  cement  as  well  as
agricultural goods like rice and sugar.[15] In the 1990s,

allow  his  transport  company  to  manage  their  fleet  of
staff buses, a proposal that was also approved.

Today, the Dangote Group is one of the largest conglomerates in Africa,
with  international  operations  in  Benin,  Ghana,  Zambia,  and  Togo.  The
Dangote  Group  has  moved  from  being  a  trading  company  to  being  the
largest industrial group in Nigeria, encompassing divisions like Dangote
Sugar Refinery, Dangote Cement, and Dangote Flour.[16] Dangote Group
dominates  the  sugar  market  in  Nigeria,  and  its  refinery  business  is  the
main  supplier  (70  percent  of  the  market)  to  the  country's  soft  drink
companies,  breweries,  and  confectioners.  The  company  employs  more
than 11,000 people in West Africa.

In July 2012, Dangote approached the Nigerian Ports Authority to lease
an abandoned piece of land at the Apapa Port, which was approved.[17]
He  later  built  facilities  for  his  sugar  company  there.  It  is  the  largest
refinery in Africa and the third largest in the world, producing 800,000
metric  tons  of  sugar  annually.  The  Dangote  Group  owns  salt  factories
and flour mills and is a major importer of rice, fish, pasta, cement, and fertilizer. The company exports
cotton,  cashew  nuts,  cocoa,  sesame  seeds,  and  ginger  to  several  countries.  Additionally,  it  has  major
investments in real estate, banking, transport, textiles, oil, and gas.

Dangote in 2011

In  February  2022,  Dangote  announced  the  completion  of  the  Peugeot  assembling  facility  in  Nigeria
following  his  partnership  with  Stellantis  Group,  the  parent  company  of  Peugeot,  and  the  Kano  and
Kaduna  state  governments.  The  new  automobile  company,  Dangote  Peugeot  Automobiles  Nigeria
Limited  (DPAN)  factory,  which  is  based  in  Kaduna,  commenced  operations  with  the  roll-out  of  the
Peugeot 301, 508, 3008, 5008, and Landtrek.[18]

On  22  May  2023  in  Lekki,  Nigeria,  Dangote  commissioned  the  Dangote  Refinery.  The  plant  plans  to
export surplus petrol, turning Africa's biggest oil producer into an export hub for petroleum products. It
also plans to export diesel, according to Dangote, who funded the refinery's construction. The refinery is
situated  on  a  6,180-acre  (2,500  hectares)  site  at  the  Lekki  Free  Trade  Zone,  Lekki,  Lagos  State.  It  is
supplied  with  crude  oil  by  the  largest  sub-sea  pipeline  infrastructure  in  the  world  at  1,100  kilometres
(680 mi) long.

In May 2024, Aliko Dangote reaffirmed his ambitions regarding the re-appropriation of energy resources
in  Africa:  “My  dream  is  to  use  raw  materials  from  Africa,  refine  them  and  sell  them  on  our  own
market.[19]

Wealth

Dangote  became  Nigeria's  first  billionaire  in  2007.[20]  Dangote  reportedly  added  $9.2  billion  to  his
personal  wealth  in  2013,  according  to  the  Bloomberg  Billionaires  Index,  making  him  the  30th-richest
person in the world at the time, and the richest person in Africa.[21] In 2015, the HSBC leaks revealed that
Dangote was a HSBC client and that he had assets in a tax haven in the British Virgin Islands.[22][23]

Together with his brother, Sayyu Dantata, Dagnote is linked to shell companies residing in tax havens by
the Panama Papers, Paradise Papers[24] and the Pandora Papers.[25]

In April  2024,  Dangote  was  the  wealthiest  person  in Africa,  with  an  estimated  net  worth  of  US$13.9
billion.[26][2] By the end of August, his wealth was estimated by Bloomberg at $US13.4 billion,[1] and the
title was relinquished to Johann Rupert as Africa's richest person.[27]

Political activity

Dangote had a prominent role in the financing of President Olusegun Obasanjo's re-election bid in 2003,
to which he gave over N200 million (US$2 million). He contributed N50 million (US$500 thousand) to
the National Mosque under the aegis of "Friends of Obasanjo and Atiku". Dangote also contributed N200
million to the Presidential Library. These highly controversial gifts to members of the ruling PDP party
have  generated  significant  concerns  despite  highly  publicized  anti-corruption  drives  during  Obasanjo's
second term.[28]

In 2011, Dangote was appointed by President Goodluck Jonathan to serve as a member of his economic
management  team.[29]  In  2017,  rumors  circulated  that  Dangote  was  considering  a  run  for  President  of
Nigeria  in  the  2019  election.  Dangote  declined  to  run  and  asserted  that  he  does  not  intend  to  run  for
elected office.[30][31] Instead, Dangote went on to serve on a special advisory committee for Muhammadu
Buhari's reelection campaign.[32]

Other activities

Philanthropy
Dangote  has  worked  alongside  the  Bill  &  Melinda  Gates  Foundation  on  public  health  issues.[33]  In
August 2014, he donated ₦150 million ($750,000) to assist the Nigerian government's efforts to stop the
spread of Ebola.[34][35] In May 2016, he pledged $10 million to support Nigerians affected by the Boko
Haram insurgency.[36] In March 2020, he donated ₦200 million ($500,000) towards the fight against the
spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria.[37]

Football

In  2019,  Dangote  and  Femi  Otedola  promised  to  give  the  Nigerian  national  football  team  $75,000  for
every goal scored in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).[38] Dangote is an avid fan of English football
team Arsenal FC and has shown interest in buying the club.[39] In 2020, he made a donation to Nigeria's
sport ministry to help renovate the country's national sports stadium in Abuja.[40]

Personal life

Dangote  lives  in  Lagos.[41]  He  owns  two  private  jets  and  reportedly  works  12  hours  every  day  from  5
a.m. to 5 p.m. and runs 10 miles on a treadmill almost every day.[20]

Dangote married Zainab Dangote in 1977, but they divorced at an unknown date. He was later married to
Mariya Muhammad Rufai until their divorce, though the dates of the wedding and divorce are unknown.
